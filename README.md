# About the grainger-illinois GitHub Organization

This GitHub organization was created by Dave Mussulman for the Grainger College of Engineering use. 

Administrative requests can go to mussulma@illinois.edu or engrit-help@illinois.edu

The intention behind this organization is a pre-existing, pre-configured GitHub organization for college use, especially where making other organizations doesn't make sense. That includes:
* Wanting to use the university GitHub enterprise license without needing to setup their own org
* Wanting to put just a single repository or small number of them online, where a full organization is heavyweight
* Wanting a rapid option, as this is ready to use today and organization creation takes some time

The caveat is that this would be a shared organization, where repository owners get full rights to their stuff but might need admin intervention for some settings or configurations. 

This is also an experiment of how different siloed groups can share a larger, single organization. (GitHub corporate, for example, does all of their internal management in a single organization with many different repositories and permissions, but under a single org umbrella.) We'd wondered how large we could make an org at UIUC-- the whole Urbana campus? Dave can't speak to that, but he can support Engineering, and thus this was made.
